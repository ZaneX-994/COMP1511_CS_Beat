[COMP1511 Extension Work]

Write a summary of how you made the changes that you did:

[E1:Summary] {{{
In order to merge beats, I first added a helper function 'count_notes_intrack' to
count the number of notes in the range of 'beats_to_merge'. Then calculate the 
most numer of notes each beat should have. 

Once the number of notes is equal or greater than the number calculated above, 
stop merging current beat and make next beat selected.
Then start to merge beats into next beat.

Therefore a helper function to count the number of current select beat is needed.

In order to merge beats, I chose to insert nodes into the select beat to achieve
it. In that function, I use two pointers prev_select and curr_select to find the 
position where the insert note should be. If there is a same note in select beat,
then free the inser note and move to the next one.

Every time a beat is merged then free that beat.

Write two tests to test your implementation of Extension 1 (Merging).

*This test should *ONLY* test merging into 1 beat.*
[E1:Test 1] {{{
a 1 5
A
a 1 2
a 1 3
A
>
M 2 1
}}}

*This test can test merging into any number of beats*
[E1:Test 2] {{{
a 1 3
a 1 5
A
a 2 5 
a 2 7
a 3 2
A
a 1 2
a 1 3
A
>
M 3 1
}}}
